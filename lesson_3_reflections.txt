When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I want to collaborate with others, and when I want to keep a copy of my work
in the web.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because in that way I have control of what branch I want to pull and when I
want to pull it. In this way, I can avoid conflicts, or replacing content
automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

forks are copies made directly on Github of one repository. Clones are copies
made locally from a remote or from another local repository. Branches are
different versions of the same code that diverges in commits, it means they
have different commits after certain commit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It can be created another branch with fetch, review changes and solve conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

It is good to have something like a share folder. The solution would require
a lot of rules and guidelines for avoiding conflicts, and may be a lot of emails.
Github is an easier way since it already defines a lot of that rules and have
them coded.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
