What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder for storing the metadata is created. It is required for making a
directory to become a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate zone which allows to group files that are going to be added
to the repository, but that have not been added yet. The value is that it allows
to group the addition operation of several files in a single commit. This is important
for following the rule of thumb: one commit per logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Grouping changes that are related and that make up a logical change only.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When I want to add a big change, or a new feature, and still have a working
version to show. Branch's feature allow to have multiple versions of the code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams establish the parenting relationship of each git branch. It is useful
to see how the code evolves and to detect unreachable paths.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The result is a new commit with two parents. So it is represented as node with 
two roots.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Git automatically commit makes the work easier by comparing the lines and detecting
possible changes and conflicts. However, merging manually even if it is tedious is
safer, It hink fit merge is nice to have and use with some guidelines that reduce
the conflicts.
