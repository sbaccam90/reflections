How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate zone which allows to group files that are going to be added
to the repository, but that have not been added yet. The value is that it allows
to group the addition operation of several files in a single commit. This is important
for following the rule of thumb: one commit per logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Grouping changes that are related and that make up a logical change only.
